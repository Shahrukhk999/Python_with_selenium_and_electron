# Python_with_selenium_and_electron
HI all its my effort for connecting selenium with electron if you want to connect selenium with electron application make sure you have compatible chrome version with electron version
if you want to run this in CI?CD you need to create a virtual enviroemnt
For that you need to insstall XVFB
after that run command 


 #xvfb python3 sample.py
